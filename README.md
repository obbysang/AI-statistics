# AI Models Statistics Visualization

This repository contains a Python script to visualize statistics about leading AI models using interactive plots. The script is designed to run in Google Colab and uses libraries like `pandas` and `plotly` for data manipulation and visualization.

---

## **Features**
- **Dataset**: Includes key statistics about leading AI models such as GPT-4, BERT, T5, ResNet, and YOLOv4.
- **Interactive Plots**:
  - Bar plot for model parameters.
  - Scatter plot for accuracy vs. training time.
  - Line plot for release years.
  - Combined dashboard for all statistics.
- **CSV Export**: The dataset is exported to a CSV file (`ai_statistics.csv`) for further analysis.

---

## **Requirements**
To run the script, you need the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`
- `plotly`

- You can install these libraries using the following command:
pip install plotly pandas

## *Usage*
Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
Run the Script:

Open the ai_statistics.py file in Google Colab or any Python environment.

Execute the script to generate the interactive plots.

View the Results:

The script will display interactive plots in your browser or notebook environment.

The dataset will be saved as ai_statistics.csv in the repository.
